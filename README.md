# Setup Guide - A hardcore minimal Alpine Linux environment for daily driving and embedded devices

### Why Alpine Linux
- Extremely lightweight
- Fast, secure boot
- Works on modern and ancient machines as well as edge and embedded devices

### Cons
- Uses musl not GNU
- Some basic things like bluetooth and audio require much more setup

# Step 1 - Installing Alpine Linux
**Time estimate:** 15-45min

These are the exact steps I take when installing Alpine on a laptop or desktop I intend to use for work and play. Most of the time is spent waiting for the system to install and encrypt

- Burn Alpine Linux to USB
  - I formatted my drive with Ventoy, which lets you store/boot multiple ISO files while still being using the USB for storing other files (https://www.ventoy.net/en/index.html)
  - I then added Alpine Linux Standard x86_64 ISO to the USB (https://www.alpinelinux.org/downloads/)
- I then booted into Alpine Linux, selecting grub2 within the Ventoy bootloader
- After it boots, I typed `root` in the "localhost login" shell (no password needed)
- I then typed `setup-alpine` to start setup
  - Setup Keyboard: Typed `us` for keyboard layout and `us` for variant
  - Setup hostname: Used default `localhost`
  - Interface: typed `wlan0` to setup wifi
    - then selected my network
    - then typed the password
    - used default `dhcp` for IP address
    - typed `done` as I did not need to setup an ethernet
    - typed default 'n' for setting up manual config
  - Root password: typed a root password twice
  - Timezone: typed `US/` (with a slash) then my timezone `Pacific`
  - Proxy: used default `none`
  - Network Time Protocol: typed `busybox` instead of the default `chrony` since it's more lightweight
  - APK Mirror: typed `r` for random one
  - User: typed a username
    - retyped username as full name
    - typed password twice
    - used default 'none' for ssh key/url
    - used default `openssh` for ssh server
  - Disk & Install
    - Typed `nvme0n1` for the disk to use (my default one)
    - typed `crypt` for how I'd like to use it (meaning encrypted)
    - typed 'sys' for how I'd like to use it (it asks you this twice if you select crypt first time)
    - Wait for system to load into memory
    - typed `y` for "Erase the above disks and continue"
    - typed my harddrive encryption password twice
    - type harddrive encryption a third time to actually unlock the drive prior to installing
    - Wait for system to install
  - Type `reboot` to finish and reboot the system ðŸŽ‰

# Step 2 - Setting up your main user
We'll be using doas instead of sudo since it's more lightweight

- Login with your user
- Switch to root environment with `su root` (you will now be in the root environment)
- Install git with `apk add git`
- Clone this repository with `git clone https://github.com/kanzish/setup`
- Run the setup script with `sh setup/base.sh`
- Copy config files to your users root `cp setup/.nanorc .nanorc`
- Add your user to the root group `echo 'permit :wheel' > /etc/doas.d/doas.conf`
- Exit the root environment with `exit`

You can now use `doas` to elevate your users permissions to install more stuff etc.

# Step 3 (optional) - Desktop, audio, etc
- To install a graphical desktop, see: https://docs.alpinelinux.org/user-handbook/0.1a/Working/post-install.html
